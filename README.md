# Predictive-Drug-Target-Interaction-DTI-Model
This is a classic problem with huge commercial relevance, need using advanced deep learning techniques. A predictive Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) model uses computational methods to determine or estimate the binding likelihood or affinity between potential drug molecules and biological target proteins (e.g., receptors, enzymes, ion channels).
