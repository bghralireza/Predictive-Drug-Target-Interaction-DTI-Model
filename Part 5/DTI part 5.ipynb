    "    - For the classification task, generate a Confusion Matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN).\n",

    "- ##### Step 5.2.1: Local Interpretation via Attention/Saliency Maps\n",
    "    - If you used an Attention Mechanism (Step 3.2.3), retrieve the calculated attention weights:\n",
    "        - Drug Interpretation: Map the atom-level attention weights from the GNN back onto the 2D molecular graph. Higher weights indicate the atoms or func-tional groups most critical for the predicted binding. These are potential phar-macophores.\n",
    "        - Protein Interpretation: Map the residue-level attention weights from the CNN/RNN back onto the protein sequence.2 Higher weights indicate the amino acids most important for binding. These regions likely form the binding pock-et.\n",
    "    - Saliency Maps (General DL Models): For models without explicit attention, use tech-niques like Integrated Gradients or Grad-CAM to identify input features (at-oms/residues) that most strongly influence the final prediction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Step 5.2.2: Global Interpretation of Embeddings\n",
    "    - Take the final, fixed-size feature vectors for all drugs VD and targets VP.\n",
    "    - Use dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP to project these high-dimensional vectors into 2D or 3D space.\n",
    "    - Visualize: If the model learned useful features, similar drugs should cluster together, and targets with similar functions (e.g., kinases) should also cluster. This validates the learned representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Step 5.2.3: Case Studies\n",
    "    - Select a few True Positive and False Positive predictions from the Test Set.\n",
    "    - For the True Positives, use the attention maps to show why the model predicted binding, linking the highly weighted regions to known binding motifs or literature data, if available.\n",
    "    - Analyze False Positives to understand where the model failed (e.g., failed to account for a steric clash not captured by 1D sequence data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Documentation and Future Work\n",
    "- ##### Step 5.3.1: Final Report\n",
    "    - Compile all findings: the complete DTI workflow, chosen architecture, training parame-ters, and all calculated Test Set metrics.\n",
    "    - Clearly document the achieved performance, including a comparison to established DTI benchmarks (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Step 5.3.2: Project Limitations and Next Steps\n",
    "    - Acknowledge limitations (e.g., lack of 3D structural data, reliance on sequence only).\n",
    "    - Propose logical future enhancements, such as:\n",
    "        - Transfer learning using pre-trained protein or molecule models (like ESM or G-LoL).\n",
    "        - Integrating features derived from 3D structures (e.g., predicted AlphaFold structures).\n",
    "        - Developing a web interface (dashboard) for live, user-friendly predictions.\n"
